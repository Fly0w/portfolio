# Portfolio

This app is my own portfolio using ReactJS for its simplicity to update with incoming projects.

## History

While I was still learning how to use ReactJS, I have decided to challenge myself and make a functional portfolio from scratch. It allowed me not only to learn many new things, such as React features, new CSS properties, and design in a more general way, but it is also functional and will help me sharing my work to potential business partners.


## Features

- Multi-language : English, Japanese, French
